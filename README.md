TOPIC 1.

-Easy International wire transfer using Blockchain.
 Large segment of consumers are suffering under existing, non-blockchain-based setup for money transfer as they incur many hidden costs. This application would remove the need to have any third party authentication for International wire transfer. This would majorly help international students to eliminate the overhead of third party commissions.

TOPIC 2.

Determine the best options to maximize return on crops.
-The use of IBM Watson API in agriculture could help determine the best crop choice or the best hybrid seed choices for a crop mix adapted to various objectives, conditions and better suited for farm’s needs. Watson can use diverse capabilities to understand how seeds react to different soil types, weather forecasts and local conditions. By analyzing and correlating information about weather, type of seeds, types of soil, probability of diseases, data about what worked best, year to year outcomes, prices or consumer needs, farmers can make decisions to maximize return on crops. This application will help farmers in taking informed decisions.

TOPIC 3.

BIG DATA Analysis in healthcare solutions (Evidence-Based Medicine).
 –In most hospitals and emergency rooms when a patient is admitted, the physician uses the same battery of tests in order to identify the cause for symptoms. Using evidence-based medicine, the doctor can match symptoms to a larger patient database in order to come to an accurate diagnosis faster and more efficiently. Big data plays a role in assimilating information from different sources and normalizing the data, so one record that describes “high blood pressure” maps to another that describes “elevated blood pressure.”
 
TOPIC 4.

-Find fake reviews on Retailer's website.
Many retailers often face a peculiar problem where imposters post misleading information about products/services provided by the Retailers. This can affect their brand value and thus they need to flag/remove such comments periodically. For this we can use Machine Learning/Spark to detect the fake reviews and flag them.

 TOPIC 5. - APPROVED
 
 -Help insurance companies identify risky and cautious drivers
Develop a cloud service which could be integrated and used by Insurance companies to identify risky and cautious auto drivers. The service should have subscription based offering. The statistical and machine learning model would use driving records of various drivers (historical data) and predict a risky driving behavior. Develop a dashboard for Insurance data analyst to visualize and predict.
