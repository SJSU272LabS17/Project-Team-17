TOPIC 1.

BIG DATA Analysis in healthcare solutions (Evidence-Based Medicine).
 –In most hospitals and emergency rooms when a patient is admitted, the physician uses the same battery of tests in order to identify the cause for symptoms. Using evidence-based medicine, the doctor can match symptoms to a larger patient database in order to come to an accurate diagnosis faster and more efficiently. Big data plays a role in assimilating information from different sources and normalizing the data, so one record that describes “high blood pressure” maps to another that describes “elevated blood pressure.”
