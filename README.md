An approach to determine the best crop option to yield maximum return.


The use of IBM Watson API in agriculture could help determine the best crop choice or the best hybrid seed choices for a crop mix adapted to various objectives, conditions and better suited for farmers needs. Watson can use diverse capabilities to understand how seeds react to different soil types, weather forecasts and local conditions. By analyzing and correlating information about weather, type of seeds, types of soil, probability of diseases, data about what worked best, year to year outcomes, prices or consumer needs, farmers can make decisions to maximize return on crops. This application will help farmers in taking informed decisions.
